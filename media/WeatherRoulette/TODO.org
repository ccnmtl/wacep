* TODO 11. System should show graphical representation of how participants
  performed against one another in rounds of a game, and among the 3 games.
  -- Where in the UI does this fit in? Is this in the "Manage" section?
* TODO 13. System should have an ad hoc capability for entering in new or
  editing data sets of seasonal forecasts.
* TODO 18. System should allow for exporting of participant data in csv.
  File format.
* TODO 26. System should not have all 3 games activated and available for
  participants, only the practice game.
  -- When will the 2 other games be activated for the user to play? Will that
  be when the practice game is completed, or does an administrator activate the
  game?

  Note: I have not added the requirements for admin console to the list.
  That will be a separate PMT task.
