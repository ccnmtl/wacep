About Streamflow 
</h2>

<p>
Streamflow, or discharge, is the volume of water that moves over a particular point over a fixed period of time. It is expressed as volume per second (e.g. m3/sec), and reflects the amount of water that runs off the land surface plus that which drains from the groundwater supply. The following factors play a role in affecting streamflow, and those in italics are illustrated by this module's interactive model<sup>1</sup>: 
</p>

<h2>
Natural factors: 
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Runoff from rainfall and snowmelt </li>
<li>Evaporation from soil and surface-water bodies </li>
<li>Transpiration by vegetation </li>
<li>Ground-water discharge from aquifers </li>
<li>Ground-water recharge from surface-water bodies </li>
<li>Sedimentation of lakes and wetlands </li>
<li>Formation or dissipation of glaciers, snowfields, and permafrost </li>
</ul>


<h2>
Anthropogenic factors: 
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Surface-water withdrawals and trans-basin diversions </li>
<li>River-flow regulation for hydropower and navigation </li>
<li>Construction, removal, and sedimentation of reservoirs and storm water detention ponds </li>
<li>Stream channelization and levee construction </li>
<li>Drainage or restoration of wetlands </li>
<li>Land-use changes such as urbanization that alter rates of erosion, infiltration, overland flow, or evapotranspiration </li>
<li>Wastewater outfalls </li>
<li>Irrigation wastewater return flow </li>
</ul>

About the image tab 
</h2>

<p>
The image tab shows a visualization of the equations that describe the movement of water as it travels from the atmosphere through the surface, into a stream, and back up into the atmosphere. You are able to adjust several variables, and then observe how changes to one variable in turn affect the rest of the system. Use the start/stop button in the lower left corner to start and stop the animation. 
</p>

<p>
Variable "a" represents perviousness, or the ease with which water infiltrates the land surface. Concrete, for example, is a much less pervious surface type than soil. 
</p>

<p>
Variable "b" represents evapotranspiration, which reflects 1) the water absorbed by the roots of plants and released through leaves into the atmosphere and 2) the water that evaporates directly from soil moisture into the atmosphere. Note that due to the Pt - bPt - aPt = Direct Runoff to River equation (introduced in Part 1 of Module 3), evapotranspiration + perviousness can never exceed 100. 1 
</p>

<p>
Variable "c" reflects the ease with which groundwater flows, which is dependent on a number of factors but is largely dependent on the porosity of the soil. 
</p>

<p>
Variable "r" reflects rainfall frequency, which ranges from very few events to very many. This should not be confused with rainfall intensity. In cases when the frequency of rainfall is higher, you will see that precipitation events occur more often and that those events exhibit high and low levels of intensity. In cases with the frequency of rainfall is low, you will see fewer occurring events, and those will also fluctuate in their intensity.

<h2>
About the "Graph" Tab 
</h2>

<p>
The graph tab shows the same data illustrated in the animated image tab. You can see that streamflow trends closely depend on those of precipitation, groundwater flow, and runoff. Slide your mouse over the lines of the graph to view the value of a particular point. 
</p>

<h2>
About the "Table" Tab 
</h2>

<p>
The table reflects the same data illustrated by both the image tab and the graph tab, only this time the information is shown in a chart.
