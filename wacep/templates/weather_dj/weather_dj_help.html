    <p>O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate; /
		What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate; /
		For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began /
		To persecute so brave, so just a man; /
		Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares, /
		Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars! /
		Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show, /
		Or exercise their spite in human woe?
