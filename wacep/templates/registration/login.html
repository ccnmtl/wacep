		<p>Welcome to the Water and Climate Education Program (WACEP)</p>
		
		<p>Caribbean islands have limited water resources, and increasing pressure on those resources from population pressure, urbanization, economic development, and tourism. Climatic variability is magnifying existing pressures. Adaptation to climate is essential, but there are few people in the region trained in how to identify and implement effective strategies to manage climate and water-related risks. </p>
		
		<p>The project team (collaborators listed below) will improve capacity to manage water resources and climate-related risk by increasing the ability of the UWI CERMES and IRI to educate professional and upper-level students in the scientific, technical and policy considerations around these issues.</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>International Research Institute for Climate Prediction and Society (IRI at Earth Institute)</li>
		<li>Center for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES) at the University of West Indies (UWI)</li>
		<li>Caribbean Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology of Barbados (CIMH)</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<p>These are the four courses in this program: </p>
		
		<ol>
		<li>Climate Information and Predictions from Seasons to Decades</li>
		<li>Introduction to Water Sustainability and Climate</li>
		<li>Climate Information for Improved Water Management</li>
		<li>Water Planning and Policy for Climate Variability and Change</li>
		</ol>
